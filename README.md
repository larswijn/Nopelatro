What if EVERYTHING in balatro was a flip of the coin? Since people think Balatro is all rng or luck, we decided to make that into a reality. 
(Almost) everything in balatro now has a 1 in 2 chance to score, retrigger, give money, or level up. And unfortunately oops all sixes can't help you. Can you win a run?
